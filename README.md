# **Sentiment Analysis Using NLP**

### **Overview**
This project performs **Sentiment Analysis** on text data using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The goal is to classify text (such as reviews or social media posts) as **positive, negative, or neutral** to understand public sentiment. The project demonstrates how to preprocess text, extract features, and apply machine learning models to perform sentiment classification.

---

## **Features**
- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Removes punctuation, stopwords, and special characters.
  - Converts text to lowercase for uniformity.

- **Feature Extraction using TF-IDF**: 
  - Converts text into numerical form using **TF-IDF vectorization**.

- **Machine Learning Models**: 
  - Trains models such as **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **SVM** for classification.

- **Performance Evaluation**:
  - Uses **accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score** to assess model performance.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries and Packages**:
  ```bash
  numpy
  pandas
  scikit-learn
  nltk
  matplotlib
  seaborn
  ```

## **How to Run the Project**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd sentiment-analysis
   ```

2. **Set up Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate    # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb
   ```

## **Dataset**
- **Source**: The dataset used contains text samples (e.g., product reviews, tweets) along with sentiment labels (positive, negative, or neutral).
- **Preprocessing Steps**:
  - Tokenization and Stopword Removal using **NLTK**.
  - Text feature extraction using **TF-IDF**.

---

## **Model Training and Evaluation**
- **Models Used**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes correct and incorrect predictions.
  - **Accuracy Score**: Measures the overall performance.
  - **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**: Evaluates class-wise performance.

---

## **Results**
- Include graphs or confusion matrix plots showcasing the performance of the models.
- **Accuracy Example**:
  - Logistic Regression: 85%
  - Random Forest: 87%
  - SVM: 89%

---

## **Future Improvements**
- Use **BERT or GPT models** for improved sentiment detection.
- Add **real-time sentiment analysis** using APIs.
- Incorporate **more complex datasets** with sarcasm detection.
